## What is Cassette?

Cassette is a native Swift / SwiftUI music client for iOS and macOS, built for people who run their own music server. It speaks the Subsonic and OpenSubsonic API, so it works with Navidrome and any other compliant server.

It's a pure streaming client for *your* library — no accounts, no subscriptions, no tracking. Your music stays between your device and your server. The iOS app is distributed via TestFlight; the macOS app ships as a notarized build through Homebrew.

Licensed under MPL-2.0.

## Features

**Listening**
- Native iOS 18+ / macOS 15 client, with a Liquid Glass design language on iOS 26 (graceful Material fallback on iOS 18)
- Background playback with lock screen and Control Center controls, plus AirPlay
- Chromecast (iOS) — cast to any Google Cast speaker or TV, with the queue still driven by Cassette. Works even when the speaker cannot reach your server itself, such as a Navidrome behind Tailscale, because Cassette will relay the audio from your phone
- True offline mode: download albums, playlists, or individual tracks
- Playback powered by the AudioStreaming engine — FLAC, MP3, AAC, WAV, and Ogg/Vorbis
- Persistent playback session — pick up where you left off after relaunching
- Lyrics support
- Shuffle, repeat, and full queue management

**Library**
- Browse by playlists, artists, albums, downloads, and favorites
- Pinned albums and playlists on the home screen
- Recently added (online) and recently downloaded (offline)
- Full-text search across your library
- Favorites synced with your server (star / unstar)
- **Cassette Wrapped** — a yearly recap of your listening

**Integrations & extras**
- **ListenBrainz** — scrobble your listens and surface recommendations (fresh releases, similar artists)
- **Home-screen widgets** (iOS)
- **Discord Rich Presence** — *experimental / pre-alpha*; shows your now-playing in Discord through the companion helper, [cassette-discord-rpc](https://github.com/CassetteLab/cassette-discord-rpc)

**Server & privacy**
- Subsonic and OpenSubsonic API, with OpenSubsonic extensions where available
- Custom HTTP headers for servers behind a reverse proxy (Cloudflare Access, Authelia, etc.)
- Credentials stored only in the iOS / macOS Keychain — zero tracking, zero analytics, all traffic direct to your server

## Installation

### macOS — Homebrew

```bash
brew trust CassetteLab/cassette
brew tap CassetteLab/cassette
brew install --cask cassette
```

This installs the notarized `Cassette.app`.

### iOS — TestFlight

Join the beta: <https://testflight.apple.com/join/pxCpfpxF>

### Build from source

1. **Requirements**
   - macOS 15 or later with Xcode 26 or later
   - A Subsonic / OpenSubsonic / Navidrome server to connect to
   - An Apple Developer account (the free tier works for personal device builds)

2. **Clone and open**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CassetteLab/cassette.git
   cd cassette
   open Cassette.xcodeproj
   ```
   Swift Package Manager resolves the dependencies automatically — no extra setup.

3. **Sign with your own team**

   Bundle IDs and App Groups are registered per Apple team, so a fork cannot sign the
   upstream identifiers. Point them at your own team once, in a local file Git ignores:

   ```bash
   make setup   # copies Config/Local.xcconfig and Makefile.local from the examples
   ```

   Then edit `Config/Local.xcconfig`:

   ```
   CASSETTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOURTEAMID
   CASSETTE_DISPLAY_NAME = CassetteDev
   CASSETTE_BUNDLE_ID = com.youruser.cassette
   CASSETTE_APP_GROUP_ID = group.com.youruser.cassette
   ```

   Every target reads those four values, so nothing in the project file needs editing.
   A different display name and bundle ID let your build sit alongside a TestFlight or
   Homebrew install rather than replacing it.

4. **Build and run**
   - In Xcode: choose an iOS 18+ device/simulator or **My Mac**, then ⌘R
   - Or from the terminal:

   ```bash
   make build       # iOS simulator
   make build-mac   # macOS
   make test        # unit tests
   make lint        # SwiftLint, strict — the same gate CI runs
   make check-cast  # list the Cast receivers this machine can see
   make ci          # everything CI runs, in the same order
   make device      # build, install and launch on a connected iPhone
   ```

   Set `DEVICE_NAME` in `Makefile.local` to the name of your iPhone for `make device`.

5. **First launch**
   - Cassette prompts for your server URL, username, and password
   - If your server sits behind a reverse proxy that needs custom request headers, expand **Advanced** and add them
   - Tap **Connect** — Cassette verifies the connection and stores credentials in the Keychain

---

## Requirements

- iOS 18 or later, or macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later
- A running Subsonic, OpenSubsonic, or Navidrome server

---

## Server compatibility

Cassette works with any server that implements the Subsonic / OpenSubsonic API, and uses OpenSubsonic extensions where available. [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org) is the recommended and primary-tested server.

If your server implements the Subsonic API and something doesn't behave, [open an issue](https://github.com/CassetteLab/cassette/issues).

## Architecture

For developers curious about the internals:

- **UI** — SwiftUI views with `@Observable @MainActor` view models; no business logic in views.
- **Services** — Swift actors (`PlayerService`, `LibraryService`, `DownloadService`, `FavoritesService`, `NowPlayingService`, …) with no SwiftUI / UIKit imports.
- **Playback** — the [AudioStreaming](https://github.com/dimitris-c/AudioStreaming) engine, wired to `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` and `MPRemoteCommandCenter` for lock screen, Control Center, and AirPlay.
- **Chromecast** — the [Google Cast SDK](https://github.com/SRGSSR/google-cast-sdk) (SRGSSR's SPM distribution) against the Default Media Receiver, iOS only. `CastManager` owns the session; `PlayerService` treats it as an alternative transport, so the queue, shuffle, repeat and scrobbling all behave the same whether audio comes out of the phone or the TV. A receiver fetches the audio itself, so when it cannot reach your server — a VPN address, a header-authenticated proxy, a certificate only the phone trusts — `CastProxyServer` serves the track from the phone instead, the same way [VLC](https://mfkl.github.io/chromecast/2018/10/21/High-performance-cross-platform-streaming-with-libvlc-and-Chromecast-on-.NET.html) and [BubbleUPnP](https://bubblesoftapps.com/bubbleupnpserver2/docs/features_and_requirements.html) do.
- **Subsonic API** — [SwiftSonic](https://github.com/CassetteLab/swiftsonic) (same author, separate repo, MIT) handles all Subsonic / OpenSubsonic communication.
- **Persistence** — SwiftData for app data (downloads, playlists, favorites cache); Keychain for credentials.
- **Concurrency** — Swift 6 strict concurrency, `Sendable` throughout, `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`.
- **Dependencies** — SwiftSonic, AudioStreaming (which brings Ogg/Vorbis binary frameworks for lossless decoding), SwiftMuse, and the Google Cast SDK on iOS. That's the full list.
- **Build configuration** — signing identifiers live in `Config/Cassette.xcconfig`, overridable per checkout by an ignored `Config/Local.xcconfig`.

## Documentation

Architecture decisions, technical notes, audits, and release runbooks live in the
**[CassetteLab knowledge vault](https://github.com/CassetteLab/obsidian)** — an Obsidian
vault versioned with Git, shared across the whole ecosystem.

Anything that explains **why** a choice was made lives there rather than in this repo,
including the CarPlay readiness audit and the release process (previously `docs/`).
`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `LICENSE` stay here.

> The vault is private to the organisation — open an issue if you need access.

## Roadmap

Cassette is built incrementally, one theme per release.

- **v1.8 — Widgets** ✅ shipped
- **v2.0 — CarPlay** (in progress)

For the full roadmap and discussion, see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/CassetteLab/cassette/discussions).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A few things before you start:

- **Discuss before coding** — open an issue or discussion before working on a feature, especially architectural changes. A PR that contradicts a design decision may be closed.
- **Match the existing style** — Swift 6 strict concurrency, no Foundation / UIKit leakage outside the service layer, dependencies kept minimal (SwiftSonic + AudioStreaming).
- **Test on real devices** — audio playback and Liquid Glass effects behave differently in the Simulator.
- **Conventional commits** — `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.
