# Contributing to Cassette

## Development Rules

### B2 — No SwiftSonic bypass, ever

All Subsonic API calls MUST go through `SwiftSonic`. No `URLSession` calls to server
endpoints directly from Cassette code.

If a SwiftSonic API is missing or awkward:
1. Note it in `APP_FEEDBACK.md` (never committed — see `.gitignore`)
2. Work around it using existing SwiftSonic methods, even if inelegant
3. Keep building — SwiftSonic 0.6.x will address the friction points

**Single exception**: a critical security bug in SwiftSonic → hotfix SwiftSonic
immediately (e.g. a 0.4.1-style patch), do not bypass.

**Alarm signal**: if you are writing more than 10 lines of networking code in Cassette
that do not go through SwiftSonic, stop and discuss.

### B3 — v1 simplifications (documented)

Three deliberate simplifications for v1. Each is marked with
`// TODO(v1.x): <planned evolution>` in the code so they are easy to find later.

| Feature | v1 | v1.x |
|---|---|---|
| Audio cache during stream | Full background download alongside stream | `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate` chunk interception |
| Permanent downloads | Foreground `URLSession` (user keeps app open) | Background `URLSession` with resume after app kill |
| Server queue sync | Best-effort `savePlayQueue`/`getPlayQueue`, silently ignored on failure | Robust bidirectional sync with multi-device merge |

### SwiftData + Actor pattern

`ModelContext` is main-thread-bound. Actor methods that read or write SwiftData
must always create and use a `ModelContext` on the MainActor:

```swift
try await MainActor.run {
    let context = ModelContext(modelContainer)
    // fetch, insert, delete, save here
}
```

`@Model` objects (e.g. `ServerConfig`) **never** leave the `MainActor.run` closure.
Return a `Sendable` DTO (`ServerSnapshot`, etc.) instead. This is the single rule
that makes the entire service layer actor-safe with SwiftData.

Tests must pass `inMemory: true` to `ModelContainer.cassette(inMemory:)` — Swift
Testing parallelises tests, so each test must own its own in-memory store.

### Architecture invariants

1. Files under `Services/` never `import SwiftUI`, `UIKit`, or `AppKit`.
2. `PlayerService` is the **single source of truth** for playback state.
   No duplicated playback state in any view model.
3. `MediaResolver` is the **single entry point** for playable URLs.
   `PlayerService` always asks `MediaResolver` — never SwiftSonic directly.
4. All dependencies injected via `init`. No singletons except `AppContainer`.
5. `NowPlayingService` is active from v1 (lockscreen / Control Center / AirPods).

### nonisolated on static properties in system type extensions

When `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` is active (our project build
setting), every `static let` or `static var` inside an `extension` on **any**
type — including system types like `Logger`, `DateFormatter`, or `JSONDecoder` —
is implicitly `@MainActor`. Reading those properties from a non-MainActor context
(an `actor`, a detached task, a `nonisolated` function) produces a Swift 6
concurrency warning today and will be a compiler error in strict mode.

**Rule**: any `static let/var` in an extension on a system type that is accessed
outside the main actor must be annotated `nonisolated`:

```swift
// ✗ implicitly @MainActor under SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION=MainActor
extension Logger {
    static let keychain = Logger(subsystem: "...", category: "...")
}

// ✓ safe across all isolation boundaries
extension Logger {
    nonisolated static let keychain = Logger(subsystem: "...", category: "...")
}
```

This is safe whenever the type is `Sendable` and holds no mutable state.
`Logger` (OSLog), `DateFormatter` created once, immutable `JSONDecoder`, and
similar value-type constants all qualify. When in doubt, add `nonisolated` —
the compiler will tell you if it cannot be applied.

### Design system

All UI code must use the design system. Never write magic-number spacing, hardcoded colors, or one-off font modifiers in view files.

| Resource | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Spacing | Use `CassetteSpacing.*` (`l` = 16, `xxl` = 24, etc.) — never a raw `CGFloat` literal |
| Corner radii | Use `CassetteCornerRadius.*` — never `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8)` with a bare number |
| Typography | Use `Font` extensions from `CassetteTypography.swift` (`.cassetteCellTitle`, `.cassetteCaption`, etc.) |
| Cover art | Use `CoverArtCard` — never `CoverArtView + .clipShape + .shadow` inline |
| Colors | Semantic SwiftUI colors for text/background; `cassetteAccent` only on primary interactive elements |
| Empty/error states | Use `EmptyStateView` — never `ContentUnavailableView` |

See `Cassette/DesignSystem/README.md` for the full component catalogue, token reference, and rules for adding new components or colors.

### Keychain policy

Credentials (passwords, `customHeaders`) are **never** in:
- `UserDefaults`
- Log statements (even at debug level)
- Error messages shown to users

Keychain only. `ServerCredentials` carries an `// IMPORTANT: Never persist outside of Keychain` comment to reinforce this.

### Commit style

Conventional commits: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`.
One atomic commit per subtask. Propose a plan and wait for validation before
implementing each numbered Étape.

## Quality gates

Before pushing to `origin/main`, the build must be **warning-free** (excluding
the known acceptable warnings listed below).

`make build`, `make build-mac` and `make test` wrap the commands below for day-to-day
work. Run the raw invocations before pushing: they clean first, which the Makefile
does not, and only a clean build re-emits every diagnostic.

Run the following commands and inspect the filtered output — it must be empty:

```sh
# iOS (required)
xcodebuild -scheme Cassette \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  clean build 2>&1 \
  | grep -E "warning:|error:" \
  | grep -v "/SourcePackages/" \
  | grep -v "appintentsmetadataprocessor"

# macOS — enabled in v1.1
# xcodebuild -scheme Cassette \
#   -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' \
#   clean build 2>&1 \
#   | grep -E "warning:|error:" \
#   | grep -v "/SourcePackages/" \
#   | grep -v "appintentsmetadataprocessor"

# Test target (required) — the app-only gate let the test target rot unseen.
# CLEAN on purpose: incremental builds only re-emit diagnostics for recompiled
# files and have repeatedly hidden real warnings. Two quirks force this shape:
# the CassetteTests scheme has no buildables for the `clean` action (any
# invocation containing `clean` fails with "no destinations"), hence the Build
# dir wipe; and build-for-testing rejects generic destinations, hence the
# simctl-derived simulator id.
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cassette-*/Build
UDID=$(xcrun simctl list devices available \
  | grep -m1 "iPhone" \
  | grep -oE "[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{12}")
xcodebuild -scheme CassetteTests \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$UDID" \
  build-for-testing 2>&1 \
  | grep -E "warning:|error:" \
  | grep -v "/SourcePackages/" \
  | grep -v "appintentsmetadataprocessor"
```

Any new warning must be fixed or explicitly added to the "Known acceptable
warnings" section with full justification before merging.

---

## Known acceptable warnings

These warnings appear during normal builds and are **intentionally not fixed**.
Each entry records source, cause, action taken, and when to revisit.

---

### AppIntents metadata extraction skipped

```
warning: Metadata extraction skipped. No AppIntents.framework dependency found.
```

| Field    | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Source** | Xcode build system — `appintentsmetadataprocessor` runs on every project |
| **Cause** | The processor is injected by Xcode regardless of whether the project uses AppIntents. It emits this warning when `AppIntents.framework` is absent from the dependency graph. |
| **Action** | Suppressed by the `-v "appintentsmetadataprocessor"` filter in the quality-gate commands above. No code change possible without adding the AppIntents dependency. |
| **Revisit** | If Cassette adopts App Intents (Siri shortcuts, Spotlight actions) in a future version — integrate AppIntents properly and remove this entry. |

---

### App icon PNG size mismatch

```
warning: AppIcon.appiconset/cassette-wow-loop-1024 N.png is 1024x1024 but should be <size>.
```

| Field    | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Source** | `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` — 10 PNG slots for macOS sizes 16×16 through 512×512 |
| **Cause** | All macOS app icon slots are currently filled with the 1024×1024 master PNG. Xcode compiles them but emits a size-mismatch warning for each slot that expects a smaller size. iOS is unaffected (uses a single 1024×1024 slot). |
| **Action** | Pre-existing warning — no code fix possible. Proper resolution requires exporting correctly-sized PNG variants (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 pt, 1× and 2×) from the original icon source and replacing the placeholder assets. |
| **Revisit** | Before App Store submission for the macOS target — regenerate the full icon set from the final design source. |
